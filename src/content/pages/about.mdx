## _coding_journey

---
### in the beginning
  In the early days of my journey, I embraced the Python programming language. The world of coding opened up to me, and I started to grasp the fundamental concepts of programming.

### exploring new horizons
  The year 2020 was marked by a quest for new knowledge. I ventured into the realm of C++, laying the foundation for more intricate projects. Simultaneously, I delved into web development, mastering the trifecta of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### crafting meaningful creations
  The dawn of 2021 witnessed the birth of "CovidCare," a React Native application that provided crucial COVID-19 information. Additionally, I unveiled my masterpieceâ€”a Communication Through Visible Light (CTVL) device, skillfully crafted with Arduino and MicroPython. The world of computer vision beckoned, leading me to master OpenCV.

### diverse ventures
  As the calendar flipped to 2022, I developed my first production websiteâ€”a platform for my college's science club. The year unfolded with diverse projectsâ€”robotics, embedded system programming, and even Telegram bots. Flutter and React Native applications came alive, controlling robots and paving the way for math visualization adventures.

### advancing into complexity
  The year 2023 has been nothing short of remarkable. I engineered a Student Management System for my college, empowering administrative tasks. An intelligent learning bot powered by GPT-4 came into being, providing educational assistance like never before. Self-driving car simulations using genetic algorithms opened doors to the world of autonomous vehicles.

### collaborative innovations

One of my proudest achievements has been the creation of "TopsNet," an open-source project that harnesses the power of the Zenodo API. With AI at its core, TopsNet can decipher research papers, fostering collaboration among researchers worldwide. A community-driven initiative, it paves the way for collective knowledge advancement.

### toward new horizons

I find myself engrossed in the intricacies of deep learning using PyTorch. The MERN stack has become a trusted ally, allowing me to craft full-stack applications that bring ideas to life. The journey continues, as every day presents new opportunities to explore, learn, and innovate.
