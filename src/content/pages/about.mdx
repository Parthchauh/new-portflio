## Programming journey

---

### Beginning the Journey

Back when I started out, Python was my go-to language. It opened up a whole new world of coding for me, helping me grasp the basics of programming.

### Exploring New Paths

In 2020, I decided to dive into new things. I learned C++, which laid the groundwork for more complex projects. At the same time, I got into web development, mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. At the end of 2020, I made "CovidCare", a React Native app that gave vital COVID-19 info.

### Creating Meaningful Projects

In 2021, I built something specialâ€” a device called Communication Through Visible Light (CTVL), using Arduino and MicroPython. Then, I delved into computer vision, learning OpenCV.

### Trying Different Things

By 2022, I had made my first real website for my college's science club. I worked on all sorts of projects that yearâ€”like robotics, programming for embedded systems, and even making Telegram bots. I also got into making apps with Flutter and React Native, controlling robots and exploring math visually.

### Stepping Up Complexity

2023 was a big year for me. I created a Student Management System for my college and built an intelligent learning bot using GPT-3. I even simulated self-driving cars using genetic algorithms.

### Collaborative Projects

One of my proudest moments was creating "NexusOS" for NASA's Space Apps Challenge with my team, Cholo Bangladesh. It's been a real adventure, learning loads along the way. Doing it solo was tough but so worth it. Making NexusOS taught me a ton about space tech and coding. Getting picked as a Global Nominee feels awesome and makes all the hard work worth it. Big thanks to everyone who cheered me on!

### Looking Ahead

Nowadays, I'm deep into deep learning with PyTorch. I'm also using the MERN stack to build full-stack apps. Every day brings new chances to explore, learn, and come up with new ideas.

## A closing note

As I look back on my journey, I'm reminded how technology is like a blank canvas where ideas bloom. Every line of code, every project, and every cool thing I've created has added to my story. With a heart full of curiosity, I can't wait to see what's next in my coding adventure.

Hey, feel free to hit me up if you wanna chat, collaborate, or even start your own journey! Programming's like a big playground with tons to explore, so let's dive in together! ðŸ˜ŠðŸš€
