## PyTorch Tensor Operations Cheat Sheet

### Creating Tensors
1. Create a tensor:
   ```python
   tensor = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3])
   ```

2. Create a zero tensor:
   ```python
   zeros = torch.zeros(3, 3)
   ```

3. Create an identity matrix:
   ```python
   identity = torch.eye(3)
   ```

4. Create a tensor with random values:
   ```python
   rand_tensor = torch.rand(3, 3)
   ```

5. Create a tensor with specific range:
   ```python
   range_tensor = torch.arange(0, 10, 2)
   ```

### Indexing and Slicing
1. Index a tensor:
   ```python
   element = tensor[0]
   ```

2. Slice a tensor:
   ```python
   slice = tensor[1:3]
   ```

3. Access rows/columns:
   ```python
   row = tensor[0, :]
   col = tensor[:, 0]
   ```

### Shape Manipulation
1. Get tensor shape:
   ```python
   shape = tensor.shape
   ```

2. Reshape tensor:
   ```python
   reshaped = tensor.view(2, 2)
   ```

3. Flatten tensor:
   ```python
   flattened = tensor.flatten()
   ```

### Arithmetic Operations
1. Addition:
   ```python
   result = tensor1 + tensor2
   ```

2. Subtraction:
   ```python
   result = tensor1 - tensor2
   ```

3. Multiplication:
   ```python
   result = tensor1 * tensor2
   ```

4. Division:
   ```python
   result = tensor1 / tensor2
   ```

### Element-wise Operations
1. Element-wise square root:
   ```python
   sqrt = torch.sqrt(tensor)
   ```

2. Element-wise exponentiation:
   ```python
   exp = torch.exp(tensor)
   ```

3. Element-wise logarithm:
   ```python
   log = torch.log(tensor)
   ```

4. Element-wise absolute value:
   ```python
   abs = torch.abs(tensor)
   ```

### Reduction Operations
1. Sum of all elements:
   ```python
   sum = tensor.sum()
   ```

2. Mean of all elements:
   ```python
   mean = tensor.mean()
   ```

3. Maximum element:
   ```python
   max_val = tensor.max()
   ```

4. Minimum element:
   ```python
   min_val = tensor.min()
   ```

### Matrix Operations
1. Matrix multiplication:
   ```python
   matmul = torch.matmul(matrix1, matrix2)
   ```

2. Element-wise matrix multiplication:
   ```python
   element_wise = matrix1 * matrix2
   ```

3. Matrix transposition:
   ```python
   transposed = matrix.T
   ```

4. Matrix inverse:
   ```python
   inverse = torch.inverse(matrix)
   ```

### Broadcasting
1. Expand tensor dimensions:
   ```python
   expanded = tensor.unsqueeze(0)
   ```

2. Broadcast tensors for element-wise operations:
   ```python
   result = tensor1 + tensor2
   ```

### GPU Acceleration
1. Move tensor to GPU:
   ```python
   tensor.to('cuda')
   ```

2. Perform operations on GPU:
   ```python
   result = tensor1 + tensor2
   ```

### Conversion
1. Convert to NumPy array:
   ```python
   numpy_array = tensor.numpy()
   ```

2. Convert to Python scalar:
   ```python
   scalar = tensor.item()
   ```

### Concatenation and Stacking
1. Concatenate tensors along a dimension:
   ```python
   concatenated = torch.cat([tensor1, tensor2], dim=0)
   ```

2. Stack tensors along a new dimension:
   ```python
   stacked = torch.stack([tensor1, tensor2], dim=0)
   ```

### Element-wise Comparison
1. Element-wise equality:
   ```python
   equal = torch.eq(tensor1, tensor2)
   ```

2. Element-wise greater than:
   ```python
   gt = torch.gt(tensor1, tensor2)
   ```

3. Element-wise less than or equal:
   ```python
   le = torch.le(tensor1, tensor2)
   ```

### Element-wise Logic Operations
1. Element-wise logical AND:
   ```python
   logical_and = tensor1 & tensor2
   ```

2. Element-wise logical OR:
   ```python
   logical_or = tensor1 | tensor2
   ```

3. Element-wise logical NOT:
   ```python
   logical_not = ~tensor
   ```

### Random Number Generation
1. Generate random tensor from uniform distribution:
   ```python
   uniform = torch.rand(3, 3)
   ```

2. Generate random tensor from normal distribution:
   ```python
   normal = torch.randn(3, 3)
   ```

### Element-wise Round Operations
1. Round elements to nearest integer:
   ```python
   rounded = torch.round(tensor)
   ```

2. Floor elements to nearest integer:
   ```python
   floored = torch.floor(tensor)
   ```

3. Ceiling elements to nearest integer:
   ```python
   ceiled = torch.ceil(tensor)
   ```
